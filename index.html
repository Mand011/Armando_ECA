    <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is the soccer player with the most goals ever recorded in soccer history. He has a record of 851 goals at both international and club levels. </p>
   <h2>Champions League</h2>
    <p>Ronaldo is famous for many things. But one of the things he's most famous for is for being the first-ever player to reach 5 Champions League titles. The Champions League is a tournament where only the best teams in Europe compete in order to find out which team is the best.  He won it once with Manchester United in 2008, and four times with Real Madrid (2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018). They call him "Mr. Champions" because of this.  </p>
