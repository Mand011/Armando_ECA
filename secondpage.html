    <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
    <h2>Premier League</h2>
    <p>Although Cristiano Ronaldo didn't start his career in the Premier League (England soccer league), that is the place where the world met who would one day be one of, if not the greatest to ever play the game. He transferred from Sporting CP (a Portuguese team) for a â‚¬19 fee to Manchester United. He played there for 5 years. Being one of the best players in the league with 2008 being one of the best years played by a single player. That year, he won the champions league, club world cup, premier league, and the community shield with Manchester United. When it comes to individual trophies, he won the ballon d'or, golden boot, UEFA player of the year, and the FIFA world best player. All of this while having 42 goals and 8 assists in 49 games. The crazy part was that this happened before he changed position to striker. He played midfielder that year. If he was a striker, he would've easily gotten 100+ goals that year. </p>
   <h2>Champions League</h2>
    <p>Ronaldo is famous for many things. But one of the things he's most famous for is for being the first-ever player to reach 5 Champions League titles. The Champions League is a tournament where only the best teams in Europe compete in order to find out which team is the best.  He won it once with Manchester United in 2008, and four times with Real Madrid (2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018). They call him "Mr. Champions" because of this.  </p>
